EmphAI (GreenLoop AI)
Transforming Perishable Overstock into Sustainable Assets using AI
📌 Overview

EmphAI (GreenLoop AI) is an AI-driven, sustainability-focused platform designed to detect perishable overstock before expiry and intelligently redirect it into circular economy channels such as biofuel production, composting, or sustainable packaging.

The project focuses on leveraging data intelligence and exploratory analysis to enable proactive decision-making, reduce food waste, and quantify environmental impact for large-scale retailers.

🎯 Problem Statement

Perishable goods often expire due to demand fluctuations, improper forecasting, or storage constraints.
Traditional waste-handling methods are:

Reactive rather than proactive

Costly and inefficient

Environmentally damaging

This results in financial losses, increased landfill waste, and avoidable carbon emissions.

💡 Solution: EmphAI

EmphAI introduces a data-driven circular economy infrastructure that identifies spoilage risks early and enables sustainable rerouting of goods.

This repository focuses on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase that lays the foundation for predictive modeling and optimization.

🔍 Project Scope (EDA-Focused)

The current implementation emphasizes Exploratory Data Analysis to uncover critical patterns influencing spoilage and overstock.

Key Analysis Areas:

Perishable SKU behavior across time

Shelf-life and inventory turnover trends

Seasonal and event-driven demand patterns

Temperature and cold-storage variability

Overstock frequency by category and location

These insights directly inform:

Spoilage risk indicators

Feature selection for predictive models

Sustainability intervention prioritization

🧠 System Architecture (Conceptual)

Overstock Prediction Engine (Planned)

Time-series forecasting (Prophet, LSTM)

Spoilage likelihood classification

SKU-level urgency scoring (“GreenLoop Index”)

Dynamic Waste Routing Engine (Planned)

Optimization-based matching to sustainability partners

Route and pickup scheduling

Cost vs. sustainability return trade-offs

Sustainability Impact Dashboard (Planned)

Waste diverted from landfill

CO₂ offset estimation

Biofuel and material recovery metrics

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

Time-series & statistical analysis techniques

(Modeling and optimization components are part of future phases.)

📊 Key Outcomes from EDA

Identification of high-risk perishables prone to early spoilage

Strong correlation between temperature variance and spoilage rates

Seasonal demand spikes significantly impacting overstock volume

Clear prioritization signals for sustainability routing
